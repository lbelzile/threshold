\usage{
vmetric.diag(
  xdat,
  thresh,
  B = 199L,
  type = c("qq", "pp"),
  dist = c("l1", "l2"),
  neval = 1000L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdat}{vector of observations}

\item{thresh}{vector of thresholds}

\item{B}{number of bootstrap replications}

\item{type}{type of graph, either \code{pp} for probability-probability plots or \code{qq} for quantile-quantile plots}

\item{dist}{string; the distance used, either absolute distance (\code{l1}) or Euclidean distance (\code{l2})}

\item{neval}{number of points at which to estimate the metric. Default to 1000}
}
\description{
Poor man's adaptation of Varty et al. for the
independent and identically distributed case
with no rounding.
}
\details{
The algorithm proceeds by first computing the maximum
likelihood algorithm and then simulating datasets from
replication with parameters drawn from a bivariate normal
approximation to the maximum likelihood estimator distribution.

For each bootstrap sample, we refit the
 model and convert the quantiles to
 xponential or uniform variates.
The mean absolute or mean squared distance
is calculated on these. The threshold
returned is the one with the lowest value
of the metric.
